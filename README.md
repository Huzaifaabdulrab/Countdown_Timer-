# Countdown_Timer-
This script is a Node.js program that prompts the user to enter a duration in seconds using the inquirer library. After receiving the input, it calculates the duration in seconds and starts a countdown timer. The timer continuously updates and displays the remaining time in minutes and seconds until the timer expires. Once the timer expires, it prints a message indicating that the timer has expired. If the user enters an invalid input (not a number), it prompts them to enter a valid number.

The script relies on the date-fns library for date manipulation and chalk for colorful console output. It's designed to be run from the command line using Node.js.
